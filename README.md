To create a proper README file for your code on GitHub, you should clearly describe the purpose of the code, its functionality, and how users can run it. Here's an example of how you can structure the README for your code:

Student Information and Marks System
Overview
This Python program demonstrates an example of class inheritance by implementing a simple system that stores and displays student information along with their marks. The program consists of three classes:

student: Stores personal information such as name, age, grade, and roll number.
Marks: Inherits from student and collects marks for four subjects.
final: Inherits from Marks and provides additional information (address and pin code).
Features
Collects personal details (name, age, grade, and roll number) of the student.
Collects marks for four subjects.
Displays the personal details along with the total marks.
Displays additional information like address and pin code.
How It Works

Personal Information: The student class is responsible for collecting basic details like the student's name, age, grade, and roll number using the personalinformation() method.

Marks Collection: The Marks class inherits from student and adds functionality to collect marks for four subjects using the subject() method.

Show Marks and Details: The Marks class also has a method show_marks() that displays the personal information along with the total marks of all subjects.

Additional Information: The final class inherits from Marks and adds extra details such as address and pin code using the information() method.

How to Use
Input Personal Information: The user will be prompted to enter the student's name, age, grade, and roll number.

Input Marks: The user will enter the marks for four subjects.

Display Output: The program will display the student's details and the total marks obtained.

Additional Details: The address and pin code are displayed automatically without input from the user.
